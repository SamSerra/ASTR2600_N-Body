# Final Project for ASTR2600: Intro to Scientic Programing 

This is ment to help guide the grader in finding where files are located for specific parts. In general, all code files are stored in the top directory. The "Output" subdirectory contains graphics and animations generated by the code. The "Data" subdirectory contains initial conditions for the simulations.

Any .txt files in */Output/...* correspond to responses to question in the project description.
