Part 3
--------------

When we halve the initial velocities, the earth falls into an elliptical orbit. This makes sense
because the earth now doesn't have enough speed to maintain a circular orbit but, because of
conservation of energy, will return to its starting point after 1 orbit.

For the RV curve, the RV of the sun changes in a way which match the ellipical orbit of earth:
faster when earth is at perihelion and slower when earth is apahelion.
